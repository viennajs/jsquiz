## Weird Numbers

Continuing our tradition to steal from Ruby Quiz:

A weird number is defined as a number, n, such that the sum of all its divisors (excluding n itself) is greater than n, but no subset of its divisors sums up to exactly n.

Write a program to find all the weird numbers less than a given input.
